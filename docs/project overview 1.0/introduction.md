# Project Overview: My Green Loop

## Introduction
**My Green Loop** is a sustainable rental platform designed to reduce single-use plastic waste by providing high-quality, reusable party supplies (plates, glasses, cutlery) for events. The project facilitates a circular economy by allowing users to rent eco-friendly alternatives instead of buying disposable ones.

- Providing a seamless booking experience for eco-friendly supplies.

- Managing inventory dynamically across different dates.
- Facilitating clear communication between the service and customers via automated notifications.

- **Automated Notifications**: WhatsApp/SMS and Email notifications for order confirmations.
- **Feedback & Impact Tracking**: Customer feedback system that feeds into public analytics showing the number of items saved from landfills.
