# 2.0 Impact Dashboard Requirements

## Overview
The **Impact Dashboard** is a visual feature designed to show users the tangible environmental difference they make by renting instead of buying disposables. 

**Core Problem to Solve**: The platform currently has low rental volume. Standard analytics graphs would look empty and discouraging (the "Empty Restaurant" problem).
**Strategy**: Use "Potential Impact" (Capacity), "All-Time" aggregates, and "Equivalencies" to make small numbers feel meaningful.

## Core Features

### 1. The "Hero" Impact Counters
Large, animated numbers at the top of the dashboard.
- **Metrics**:
  - **Waste Diverted**: Total items rented (All-time).
  - **CO2 Prevented**: Estimate based on manufacturing/transport savings (e.g., 50g per plate).
  - **Water Saved**: Estimate based on dishwashing vs. manufacturing water usage.
- **Strategy**: 
  - Never reset these counters. Even 50 items is a start.
  - Animate them counting up on page load.

### 2. Equivalencies (The "Wow" Factor)
Translate abstract numbers into relatable metaphors.
- *Logic*: `Total Items * Thickness / Height of Landmark`
- **Examples**:
  - "You've saved a stack of plates as tall as the **Golden Gate Bridge**!"
  - "That's enough plastic to fill a **school bus**!"
- **Implementation**: Simple math util on the frontend.

### 3. Catalogue Capacity (Potential Impact)
Show what *could* be saved if our inventory was fully utilized.
- **Metric**: `Total Stock * 365 days`
- **Copy**: "Our community has the power to divert **36,500** single-use items this year. Help us reach that goal!"
- **Why**: Takes the focus off "low sales" and puts it on "high potential."

### 4. Community Goal Tracker
A progress bar towards a collective milestone.
- **Target**: Next power of 10 milestone (e.g., 1,000 items -> 5,000 items).
- **Visual**: A progress bar or "filling fluid" animation.
- **Call to Action**: "Rent for your next event to push us over the line!"

## Technical Requirements

### Backend API
- `GET /api/analytics/impact`
  - Returns:
    - `totalItemsRented`: Integer (All time)
    - `totalOrders`: Integer
    - `inventoryCapacity`: Integer (Total stock * 365)
    - `usersPledged`: Integer (Anonymous "I skipped plastic today" clicks)

### Frontend Components
- **ImpactCounter**: Animated number component.
- **EquivalencyCard**: Icon + Text metaphor.
- **GoalProgress**: Radix UI Progress bar with custom styling.

## User Flows
1. **User visits /impact**: Sees global stats immediately.
2. **User rents items**: Sees "You just saved X items!" on the Thank You page.
3. **User clicks "I pledged"**: Increments the anonymous counter (stored in localStorage to prevent spamming).
