# 2.0 Impact Dashboard Requirements

## Overview
The **Impact Dashboard** is a visual feature designed to show users the tangible environmental difference they make by renting instead of buying disposables. 

**Core Problem to Solve**: The platform currently has low rental volume. Standard analytics graphs would look empty and discouraging (the "Empty Restaurant" problem).
**Strategy**: Use "Potential Impact" (Capacity), "All-Time" aggregates, and "Equivalencies" to make small numbers feel meaningful.

## Core Features

### Use these metrics for CO2 Prevented Per Use (grams) 
CO2 for Common Disposables
Disposable plates emit CO2 mainly during material production, processing, and transport.

Paper plates: Approximately 3.8–4 grams CO2e per plate.

Plastic tableware sets (including plate): Around 597 grams CO2e per person per meal, though plate-specific is lower (often 10–50g based on comparative studies).
​

Leaf or bio-plates: 20–50 grams CO2e, varying by transport and energy.
| Disposable Type                    | CO2 Prevented Per Use (grams)    | Key Sources                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Paper plate                        | 3.8–4                            | Production + transport stanfordmag+1   |
| Plastic/foam plate                 | 10–50 (conservative estimate)    | LCA studies interreg-baltic+1          |
| High-impact plastic set equivalent | Up to 100+ (pro-rated for plate) | Full meal service pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih​ |

### Use these metrics for Water Saved (liters)
Water for Disposables
Manufacturing a single paper plate requires about 8 gallons (30 liters) of fresh water, mainly for pulping and processing. Plastic or foam plates use less (under 1 gallon each) but add chemicals and energy impacts. For a meal, this adds up quickly—e.g., 80 gallons for 10 paper plates.

Washing Reusables
Modern Energy Star dishwashers use 3–6 gallons per load for 12–14 place settings, or about 0.25–0.5 gallons per plate. Hand-washing efficiently (plug sink, no running faucet) uses even less, around 0.1–0.3 gallons per plate.

Net Savings Per Switch
Avoiding one disposable plate saves 7–8 gallons versus dishwasher washing, assuming an existing reusable (production water already sunk).

| Method                | Water Per Plate (gallons) | Savings vs. Paper Disposable |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Paper production      | 8                         | -                            |
| Dishwasher wash       | 0.25–0.5                  | 7.5–7.75 sites.psu+1         |
| Hand wash (efficient) | 0.1–0.3                   | 7.7–7.9 bzyoo​               |


### 1. The "Hero" Impact Counters
Large, animated numbers at the top of the dashboard.
- **Metrics**:
  - **Waste Diverted**: Total items rented (All-time).
  - **CO2 Prevented**: Estimate based on manufacturing/transport savings (e.g., 50g per plate).
  - **Water Saved**: Estimate based on dishwashing vs. manufacturing water usage.
- **Strategy**: 
  - Never reset these counters. Even 50 items is a start.
  - Animate them counting up on page load.

### 2. Equivalencies (The "Wow" Factor)
Translate abstract numbers into relatable metaphors.
- *Logic*: `Total Items * Thickness / Height of Landmark`
- **Examples**:
  - "You've saved a stack of plates as tall as the **Golden Gate Bridge**!"
  - "That's enough plastic to fill a **school bus**!"
- **Implementation**: Simple math util on the frontend.

### 3. Catalogue Capacity (Potential Impact)
Show what *could* be saved if our inventory was fully utilized.
- **Metric**: `Total Stock * 365 days`
- **Copy**: "Our community has the power to divert **36,500** single-use items this year. Help us reach that goal!"
- **Why**: Takes the focus off "low sales" and puts it on "high potential."

### 4. Community Goal Tracker
A progress bar towards a collective milestone.
- **Target**: Next power of 10 milestone (e.g., 1,000 items -> 5,000 items).
- **Visual**: A progress bar or "filling fluid" animation.
- **Call to Action**: "Rent for your next event to push us over the line!"

## Technical Requirements

### Backend API
- `GET /api/analytics/impact`
  - Returns:
    - `totalItemsRented`: Integer (All time)
    - `totalOrders`: Integer
    - `inventoryCapacity`: Integer (Total stock * 365)
    - `usersPledged`: Integer (Anonymous "I skipped plastic today" clicks)

### Frontend Components
- **ImpactCounter**: Animated number component.
- **EquivalencyCard**: Icon + Text metaphor.
- **GoalProgress**: Radix UI Progress bar with custom styling.

## User Flows
1. **User visits /impact**: Sees global stats immediately.
2. **User rents items**: Sees "You just saved X items!" on the Thank You page.
3. **User clicks "I pledged"**: Increments the anonymous counter (stored in localStorage to prevent spamming).

## FAQ

### 1. What triggers updates to the Impact Metrics?
- **Rentals**: Metrics (`wasteDiverted`, `co2Saved`, `waterSaved`) increase automatically when a new rental order is created.
- **Admin Edits**: Updating a product's CO2 or Water savings in the Admin Dashboard immediately recalculates the total historical impact.

### 2. Does the "Community Goal" reset?
- **No.** The goal is dynamic and ever-expanding. It automatically targets the next "power of 10" milestone based on total all-time rentals (e.g., 100 -> 1,000 -> 10,000).

### 3. How is "Our Potential" calculated?
- **Formula**: `Total Stock of All Products * 365`.
- **Updates**: It increases automatically when you add new products or increase stock levels in the Admin Dashboard. It represents the theoretical maximum waste diversion if every item was rented every day of the year.
